## Wave 27: Org Context & Security Hardening ⚡

**Status**: 🔴 **IN PROGRESS**  
**Timeline**: 2025-11-26 → 2025-11-28 (2 days)  
**Focus**: P0 multi-tenancy security fixes  
**Milestone**: [#223](https://github.com/streamspace-dev/streamspace/issues/223)

### Issues in This Wave

| # | Title | Agent | Size | Status |
|---|-------|-------|------|--------|
| #212 | Org context and RBAC plumbing for API and WebSockets | Builder | L | `wave:27` `P0` |
| #211 | WebSocket org scoping and auth guard | Builder | M | `wave:27` `P0` `status:blocked` |
| #208 | Docker Agent Test Suite (v2.0 P0) | Validator | L | `wave:27` `P0` |
| #200 | Fix Broken Test Suites - API, K8s Agent, UI | Validator | M | `wave:27` `P0` |

### Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

**Builder Deliverables:**
- [ ] JWT org_id claims implemented (auth service)
- [ ] Auth middleware extracts org_id to Gin context
- [ ] All API handlers validate org scoping
- [ ] WebSocket handlers validate org authorization
- [ ] All new code tested (unit + integration)
- [ ] Test coverage >70% for auth components
- [ ] Ready for validation (ready-for-testing label added)

**Validator Deliverables:**
- [ ] Org isolation tests passing (cross-org rejection verified)
- [ ] WebSocket cross-org tests passing
- [ ] Docker agent test suite passing
- [ ] Broken test suites fixed
- [ ] Overall coverage >70%
- [ ] No P0 regressions
- [ ] Security audit complete (org context)

**Scribe Deliverables:**
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (org context feature entry)
- [ ] docs/MULTI_TENANCY.md created
- [ ] SECURITY.md org isolation section added
- [ ] README.md updated with security note

**Architect Goals:**
- [ ] Daily standup conducted
- [ ] Blockers identified & resolved
- [ ] Master integration gates passing
- [ ] Wave completed on schedule
- [ ] Wave retrospective documented

### Daily Progress

**Monday 2025-11-26 (Start)**
- [ ] Wave issues assigned to agents
- [ ] Blocker mitigation plan established
- [ ] Builder starts on #212 (blocker for #211)
- [ ] Validator begins breaking test suite triage
- [ ] Scribe reviews design docs for multi-tenancy

**Tuesday 2025-11-27 (Mid-point)**
- [ ] #212 implementation ~80% complete
- [ ] #200 tests fixed
- [ ] #208 test suite foundation written
- [ ] Security implications documented
- [ ] Scribe has CHANGELOG draft

**Wednesday 2025-11-28 (Completion Target)**
- [ ] All issues reach ready-for-testing
- [ ] Validation complete
- [ ] Master merge gates passing
- [ ] Documentation final
- [ ] Retrospective: Proceed to Wave 28?

### Blocker Mitigation

**Identified Dependencies:**
- #211 **blocked by** #212 (org context must be implemented first)
- #208 depends on #200 (broken tests must be fixed)

**Escalation Path:**
1. Daily standup identifies blockers
2. Architect notifies affected agent
3. Re-prioritize wave if needed
4. Document decision in wave issue comments

**If Delayed:**
- Move #211 to Wave 28 (non-critical if #212 doesn't complete)
- Push #208 to Wave 28 if not critical for release
- Keep #200 (fixing broken tests is non-negotiable)

## Adjustment Protocol

If Wave Falls Behind:

1. **Identify**: Daily standup exposes delays
2. **Assess**: How much time lost? Can we catch up?
3. **Decide**: 
   - Extend wave by 1 day? (shifts everything back)
   - De-scope issue? (move to Wave 28)
   - Add resources? (pull from Wave 28)
4. **Communicate**: Update wave issue with rationale
5. **Document**: Note in retrospective for next wave

**Recent Adjustments**: None yet (Wave 27 just started)
